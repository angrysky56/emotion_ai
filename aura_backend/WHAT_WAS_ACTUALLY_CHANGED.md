# CORRECTED: What Was Actually Removed vs. Kept

## ‚úÖ KEPT - All Essential MCP Tools:
- `sqlite` - Database operations
- `desktop-commander` - Desktop automation  
- `arxiv-mcp-server` - Research papers
- `package-version` - Version checking
- `mcp-code-executor` - Code execution
- `mcp-logic` - Logic operations
- `neocoder` - Neo4j/coding workflows
- `AstAnalyzer` - Code analysis
- `OllamaMCPServer` - Local LLM access
- `brave-search` - Web search
- `LocalREPL` - Python REPL
- `MCP-wolfram-alpha` - Mathematical computing
- `gemini-ai` - Gemini model access
- `firebase` - Firebase operations
- `gemini-picturebook-generator` - Story generation

## ‚úÖ KEPT - All Aura Internal Tools:
- `aura.search_memories` - Memory search
- `aura.analyze_emotional_patterns` - Emotion analysis
- `aura.get_user_profile` - Profile management
- `aura.query_emotional_states` - Emotion system info
- `aura.query_aseke_framework` - Cognitive architecture
- All memvid video memory tools (if working)

## ‚ùå REMOVED - Only Conflicting Servers:
- `"aura-companion"` - Was running separate aura_server.py that conflicted with internal tools
- `"chroma"` - External ChromaDB server that conflicted with internal ChromaDB

## üì¶ ARCHIVED - Experimental/Fix Scripts:
- Various *_fix.py, *_test.py, *_compatible.py files
- Duplicate backup scripts
- Experimental memvid versions

## The Real Issue Was:
You had TWO Aura systems running simultaneously:
1. **Internal Aura** (main.py + aura_internal_tools.py) ‚úÖ KEPT
2. **External Aura MCP Server** (aura_server.py via "aura-companion") ‚ùå REMOVED

Both were trying to access the same ChromaDB, causing the 3-batch issue and memory corruption.

## Result:
- ‚úÖ All your valuable MCP tools are still available
- ‚úÖ All Aura's internal capabilities preserved  
- ‚ùå Only the conflicting duplicate Aura server removed
- üéØ Should fix the batching and memory issues
